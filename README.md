## Description

Splatty is an ASP.NET backend service designed to process videos uploaded via the frontend. It utilizes a series of powerful tools to transform video data into detailed Gaussian splat visualizations. The processing pipeline involves:

- FFmpeg: Extracts individual frames from the uploaded video.
- Colmap: Performs Structure from Motion (SfM) to reconstruct the 3D structure from the extracted frames.
- Gsplat: Generates Gaussian splat representations from the 3D structure data.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up the project locally.

### Prerequisites

- .NET 8 SDK
- FFmpeg

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/VonderTech/splatty-api.git
    ```

2. ### Navigate to the project directory
   ```sh
   cd your-repo
    ```
3. ### Navigate to the project directory
   ```sh
   dotnet restore
   ```

4. ### Configure environment variables
   ```json
   {
     "ConnectionStrings": {
     "DefaultConnection": "YourDatabaseConnectionString"
    },
      "FFmpegPath": "PathToYourFFmpeg"
    }
   ```
## Running the Development Server
1. **Start the development server**

   ```sh

## Usage

1. **Upload a Video:**

    - Send a POST request to `/api/upload` with the video file.

2. **Check Processing Status:**

    - Send a GET request to `/api/status/{videoId}` to check the status of the video processing.

3. **Retrieve Processed Result:**

    - Send a GET request to `/api/result/{videoId}` to retrieve the processed Gaussian splat result.
